# Anti Food waste app
[__Jumpertz Sacha__](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jumpertz-sacha)

Food waste is a critical global problem, with staggering statistics revealing that approximately __one-third__ (_40%_ in America) of all food produced for human consumption is wasted every year. This alarming figure not only contributes to the exacerbation of famines and hunger worldwide but also has a severe ecological impact.

The ecological impact of food waste cannot be underestimated. When food is discarded and sent to landfills, it decomposes and releases GHG, particularly methane, which is a potent contributor to climate change (Up to _10%_ of global greenhouse gases comes from food that is produced, but not eaten. Source: _United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) (2021). Food Waste Index Report 2021_). 

Additionally, the production, transportation, and disposal of wasted food require vast amounts of energy, water, and other valuable resources. I could give a bunch of impressive numbers to demonstrate how food waste is harmfull, but the conclusion will still remaisn the same, fighting food waste should be a priority.

## The app
The goal of this repo is to build an 'app' that will reduce the food waste coming from supermarket. Supermarket are not the biggest contributors to food waste, but still, when their products come to their expiration date they have no other choice than throwing the away. 

The app will be connected to the supermarket's database. It will thus have access to the products that are close to expriration date but also to the taste of the users. The mission of tha app will be to suggest to each users a recipe that maximize the number of 'saved' products and the 'happiness' of the user.

## Execution steps

* Create the databases (__IN PROGRESS__)
* Create a recommendation system (__TODO__)
* Build the app (__TODO__)

### Create tha databases
IN PROGRESS(finish readme)
In this part I created the database I will use to do my app. The recepies come from an API, and data like users profile, command history,... had to be created from scratch. I tried to create the most coherent database even though some 'concessions' had to be done. You can find a more precise description of the database and all the codes used to create it into the folder [Build_db](./Build_db).

### Recommendation system
TODO

### Build the app
TODO

## Usage
TODO (installations, build the db, update it, use the app)

## Limits
